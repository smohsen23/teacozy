<h1>ORGANIC | ALL NATURAL | CHEMICAL FREE</h1>


<p>Like how sunshine and rain are for the earth, an all-natural and pesticide free organic loose leaf tea is for our bodies.
A key to feeling your best is to avoid food and beverages that contain chemicals and artificial ingredients. 
Which is why all Tea LC teas are USDA and ECOCERT certified organic and only contain all natural, organic compliant essences.
This means our loose leaf teas are free of artificial coloring, flavoring, and are grown without pesticides or genetic 
modification.

We invite you to meditate on these deep thoughts while browsing our selection of teas.</p>
